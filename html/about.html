    <h1>WHO WE ARE:</h1>
    <h3>MEET THE BEST GUIDES IN THE INDUSTRY</h3>
    <h4>A SHORT INTRODUCTION:</h4>
    <h5>ANA</h5>
    <p>Famous for her eyesight and finding remote spots off the beaten track.</p>
    <h5>MARTA</h5>
    <p>She likes to consider herself a close friend of the beautiful and largest of all antelopes: the Giant Eland.</p>
    <h5>DIOGO</h5>
    <p>He started his career as mountain guide and has climbed Kilimanjaro 12 times!</p>
    <h5>RODRIGO</h5>
    <p>Arguably our most stylish guide, don't forget to ask him to sing you a song during your safari :)</p>
    <h5>LU√çS</h5>
    <p>His favourite animal is the cheetah and he is amazed every time he sees one.</p>

    <h3>WHAT WE DO:</h3>
    <p>We have a different approach to safaris in our DNA. A safari should not be just a lifestyle experience with a list of
        animals to tick off from a list. There is beauty in the small details, there are rewards to collect when you are
        patient. We embrace those small moments: Going out of the beaten track to where there are no more vehicles, slow
        down and spend some time watching a lion pride interacting with themselves instead of rushing to the next sighting.
        A safari should be about the feelings it provides, the experience of being out there in the wild witnessing nature
        as it is, with no rush.
