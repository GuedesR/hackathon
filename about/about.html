            <h3>WHAT WE DO:</h3>
            <p>We have a different approach to safaris in our DNA. A safari should not be just a lifestyle experience with a list of
                animals to tick off from a list. There is beauty in the small details, there are rewards to collect when you are
                patient. We embrace those small moments: Going out of the beaten track to where there are no more vehicles, slow
                down and spend some time watching a lion pride interacting with themselves instead of rushing to the next sighting.
                A safari should be about the feelings it provides, the experience of being out there in the wild witnessing nature
                as it is, with no rush.
