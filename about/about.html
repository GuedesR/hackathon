            <h3>WHAT WE DO:</h3>
            <p>We have a different approach to safaris in our DNA. A safari should not be just a lifestyle experience with a
                list of animals to tick off from a list. There is beauty in the small details, there are rewards to collect
                when you are patient. We embrace those small moments: Going out of the beaten track to where there are no
                more vehicles, slow down and spend some time watching a lion pride interacting with themselves instead of
                rushing to the next sighting. A safari should be about the feelings it provides, the experience of being
                out there in the wild witnessing nature as it is, with no rush.
